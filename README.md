The design goals for YAML:

- YAML is easily readable by humans.
- YAML data is portable between programming languages.
- YAML matches the native data structures of agile languages.
- YAML has a consistent model to support generic tools.
- YAML supports one-pass processing.
- YAML is expressive and extensible.
- YAML is easy to implement and use.

## Formats

### "Standard" YAML

**YAML HQ**

- [`yaml.org`](http://www.yaml.org) - official YAML website by Clark C. Evans
  - [YAML Spec v1.2](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) - 3rd edition, Oct 2009 
  - [YAML Quick Reference Card](http://www.yaml.org/refcard.html) - one-page cheat sheet

### "Safe" YAML, "Strict" YAML

- [`strictyaml`](https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml) - a type-safe YAML parser that parses and validates a restricted subset of the YAML specification
  - [YAML Features Removed](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/features-removed/)
    - NO Implicit Typing 
    - NO Direct representations of objects
    - NO Duplicate Keys Disallowed
    - NO Explicit tags 
    - NO Node anchors and refs
    - NO Flow style


### Nested Text  - YAML Simplified, YAML Evolved 

_"Safer" YAML - YAML Redux_

- [`nestedtext.org`](https://nestedtext.org), [(github)](https://github.com/KenKundert/nestedtext) - a human friendly data format similar to YAML but without the complexity and risk of YAML 

Example:

```
# Contact information for our officers

president:
    name: Katheryn McDaniel
    address:
        > 138 Almond Street
        > Topeka, Kansas 20697
    phone:
        cell: 1-210-555-5297
        home: 1-210-555-8470
            # Katheryn prefers that we always call her on her cell phone.
    email: KateMcD@aol.com
    additional roles:
        - board member
```

## Tips & Gotchas


**Strings with Colons (`:`)**

When to use quotes for your strings?

If your string includes a colon (`:`) followed by a space you MUST quote your string. Otherwise, the colon is interpreted as a key/value separator (e.g. _key: value_). Example:

``` yaml
title: "Text Processing with Ruby: Extract Value from the Data That Surrounds You"
title: "Sinatra: Up and Running - Ruby for the Web, Simply"
title: "Using JRuby: Bringing Ruby to Java"
```

Note: You can quote your strings using double quotes (`""`) e.g. "Using JRuby: Bringing Ruby to Java" 
or single quotes(`''`) e.g. 'Using JRuby: Bringing Ruby to Java'.



**No Tabs (\t) for Indentation - Use Spaces, Period**

Note: Always use spaces for indentation, period. 
Make sure no tabs (`\t`) have somehow ended up in your datafile leading to
unexpected results.



**Predefined Boolean 'n' No Value Constants - True/False, Yes/No, On/Off, ~/Null**

Note: The boolean `true` and `false` constants e.g.:

```
true, True, TRUE
y, Y, yes, YES, YES
on, ON, ON
false, False, FALSE
n, N, no, No, NO
off, Off, OFF
```

will become boolean values e.g. `true` or `false`.  If you want end-up with a string e.g.:

``` yaml
recommend: Yes       # note: will become => true (boolean)
```

make sure you use a quoted version e.g.:

``` yaml
recommend: "Yes"     # note: will become => "Yes" (string)
```


Note: The same holds for the no value null constants e.g.:

``` yaml
~
null, Null, NULL
```

will become => `null` (no value). Note: A key without a value will end-up with a `null` value (and not an empty string, for example). To get an empty string use `""` e.g.:

``` yaml
key1:           # note: value will become => null (no value); same as key1: null  or key1: ~
key2: ""        # note: value will become => "" (string)
```



## JSON 

_JSON is (a subset of) YAML, that is YAML is JSON but JSON is NOT YAML ;-)_

Example: Use the inline style for lists (that is, JSON arrays)
and hashes (that is, JSON objects) for an alternative "JSON-style" syntax:


``` json
[
  { "title": "football.db - Open Football Data",
    "url":   "https://github.com/openfootball" 
  },
  { "title": "beer.db - Open Beer, Brewery 'n' Brewpub Data",
    "url":   "https://github.com/openbeer" 
  }
]
```

is the same as:

``` yaml
- title : football.db - Open Football Data
  url   : https://github.com/openfootball
- title : beer.db - Open Beer, Brewery 'n' Brewpub Data
  url   : https://github.com/openbeer
```
